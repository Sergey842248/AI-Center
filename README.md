## Features

#### Versatile Digital Assistant Management
SwitchAI empowers you to take full control of your device's AI assistant capabilities:
*   **Choose & Alternate:** Easily select and switch between a wide array of installed AI assistant applications. Act as your primary device assistant, choosing from apps like those listed below.
*   **On-the-Fly Selector:** Configure SwitchAI to present a selection dialog each time you trigger your device's assist function (via buttons or gestures). This allows you to pick the most suitable AI for different tasks, enhancing your workflow and productivity.
*   **Set Default Assistant:** Prefer a consistent experience? You can also set a fixed default AI assistant to launch every time.
*   **Broad Compatibility:** Designed to support a growing list of popular AI assistant apps. (Successor to Plugin-VoiceGPT, with many code improvements and changes!)
